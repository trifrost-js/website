Welcome to **TriFrost** — your soon-to-be favorite server framework.

TriFrost isn’t just another server library; it’s a runtime-agnostic, performance-obsessed, TypeScript-first framework designed to run **anywhere** — Node.js, Bun, Cloudflare Workers — you name it.

---

### 🚀 Why it exists?
Because most server frameworks either:
- Lock you to a single runtime (Node-only, Bun-only)
- Come overloaded with magic you can’t trace
- Sacrifice performance for developer convenience (or vice versa)

TriFrost flips the table on that.

It gives you:
- **Explicit, no-magic design**: middleware, routing, context, all fully transparent
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: performance baked into the core, not sprinkled on later
- **First-class TypeScript**: powerful generics, fully typed context/state, and type-safe middleware chains
- **Built-in observability**: structured logs, tracing, and telemetry ready to go, no duct tape required

### 🌍 Where can I use it?
Pretty much anywhere modern JavaScript can run.

TriFrost is built with an adaptive core that plugs into:
- Node.js
- Bun
- Cloudflare Workers (Workerd)
- Future runtime

This means you can write your app once, **deploy it anywhere**, and scale confidently.

---

### 🧠 TLDR
- **Explicit middleware chaining**: No hidden layers. What you write is what runs.
- **Runtime adapters**: Each runtime has its own optimized adapter, but the app code stays the same.
- **Modern DX**: JSX support, SSR-ready, native-style engine, and async-safe from top to bottom.
- **Advanced typing**: Context-safe generics, type-checked middleware chains, and intelligent inference.
- **Advanced tooling**: Built-in rate limiting, caching, authentication middleware, and more.

🥶 **Stay frosty.** TriFrost is the high-performance, low-bullshit framework you’ve been waiting for.
