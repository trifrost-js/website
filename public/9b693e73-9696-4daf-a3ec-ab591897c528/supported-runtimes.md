One of **TriFrostâ€™s** most defining features is its **runtime-agnostic architecture**.

Rather than binding itself to a single backend, TriFrost adapts seamlessly across multiple JavaScript runtimes â€” allowing your **application code** to remain consistent and portable.
This means you can choose the **right execution environment** for your needs, whether thatâ€™s server-side, edge, or high-performance systems.

Below, we outline the **officially supported runtimes**, with links to both TriFrostâ€™s runtime-specific guides and the official runtime documentation.

---

### Runtime: Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is the worldâ€™s most widely used JavaScript backend runtime, known for its **rich ecosystem** and **stability**.

TriFrost integrates smoothly with Node.js, making it an ideal choice for:
- Existing applications and services already built on the **Node stack**
- Seamless use of **npm packages** and Node APIs
- Traditional **server environments** or cloud VMs

ðŸ‘‰ See the TriFrost-specific guide: [Node.js Runtime](/nodejs-runtime)

### Runtime: Bun
[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is an **all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager**, offering built-in TypeScript support and outstanding speed.

TriFrostâ€™s Bun adapter gives you:
- **Native-speed execution** using Bunâ€™s fast JavaScript engine
- Tight integration with Bunâ€™s **APIs and tooling**
- Extremely fast **cold starts** and runtime responsiveness

This makes Bun a **compelling choice** for modern apps looking to push performance boundaries.

### Runtime: Workerd
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (powered by [Workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd)) provide a **lightweight, edge-deployed** environment for JavaScript applications.

TriFrost supports Workers natively, enabling:
- **Global, low-latency deployments** at Cloudflareâ€™s edge locations
- Execution within **resource-constrained environments**
- Seamless integration with Cloudflareâ€™s **storage, KV, and routing systems**

For apps aiming to run **close to users** with minimal latency, Workers + TriFrost offer a **powerful combination**.

### Looking Ahead
TriFrostâ€™s modular runtime system is designed to support **future environments** as they emerge.
