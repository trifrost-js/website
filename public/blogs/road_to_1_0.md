### 📍 The Goal
TriFrost has been evolving quickly — modular routing, runtime flexibility, solid developer ergonomics. But a 1.0 release sets a higher bar: stability, confidence, and a contract with its users.

### 📈 Code Coverage
One of the main focuses on the path to 1.0 is expanding test coverage. Each release will steadily improve on this, not just in terms of raw percentage, but meaningful coverage — core logic, edge behavior, and platform consistency.

### 🧪 Reliability & Runtime Compatibility
Support for Bun, Node, Node + uWS, and Workerd is in place — but every runtime deserves hardened paths.
Expect more runtime-specific validation and improved error introspection in upcoming versions.

### 🧰 Breaking Less
The internal API is stabilizing. From here on out, changes will aim to preserve compatibility unless absolutely necessary — and where they do break, they’ll be communicated cleanly.

### 🛣️ What’s Next
Documentation will expand, the module system will be more declarative, examples will be added and features will be expanded.
It’s not just about hitting 1.0 — it’s about making TriFrost feel reliable, expressive, and just plain fun to build with.

**We’re on our way.**
