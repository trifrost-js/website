TriFrost 0.18.0 (**FrostBite**) is here, bringing production-ready **authentication** into the framework.

This release adds:
- **BasicAuth** — username + password over HTTP Basic
- **BearerAuth** — token-based service and API checks
- **ApiKeyAuth** — flexible header or query key validation
- **SessionCookieAuth** — secure HMAC-signed session cookies

Plug in a middleware, get type-safe \`$auth\` state, and guard your routes confidently — no extra ceremony.

Under the hood, we’ve also unified cross-runtime environment handling, ensuring cleaner, more predictable setups across Node, Bun, and Workerd with no extra ... you guessed it ... ceremony.

### A Markdown-Driven Website

Our website has quietly leveled up.

The blog and news sections now run entirely on Markdown, giving us:
- Faster, simpler content updates.
- Improved interactivity and visual polish, powered by the same engine you use in apps.
- A clear path toward the next big challenge: the docs system.

### What’s on the Horizon
Next up, we’re turning our focus to **documentation**.

We’re aiming for:
- ✅ Markdown-first docs
- ✅ Embedded doc search
- ✅ LLM-ready docs (think MCP, take the docs with you wherever you go)

It’s ambitious — but it fits the TriFrost spirit.

### Looking Ahead

This is just the start of TriFrost’s journey.

Step by step, we’re building not just a framework — but a platform that’s fast, type-safe, secure, and a pleasure to use.

Stay frosty. ❄️
