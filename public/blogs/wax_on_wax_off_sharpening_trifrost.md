There’s something deeply satisfying about refinement — the slow, careful polishing of a tool you already trust.

That’s exactly where TriFrost is right now.

### The Big Step We Just Took
Earlier this week we delivered [TriFrost 0.20.0](/news/releases/0.20.0) (**Glacier**) — a massive upgrade that replaced the old routing system (one of the last major Falcon-era holdovers) with a blazing-fast, modern **TrieRouter**.

It wasn’t just a performance boost (though it brought plenty of that).

Glacier was about **laying a clean foundation**: making sure the routing core was future-proof, deeply ergonomic, and aligned with the values TriFrost has held from the start — type safety, runtime flexibility, and **kick-ass performance**.

... and at the same time Glacier was also the last big foundational project before shifting gears.

### The Phase We’re In Now
With Glacier in place, we’re in a new chapter, one which I'm jokingly dubbing **"the wax on, wax off phase"**.

While building out the documentation, we’ve been doing a sweeping pass across the framework — finding places to smooth rough edges, align patterns, and tighten assumptions.

For the time being it’s no longer about flashy new features (though there's plenty in the pipeline); it’s about making the core feel even **better**, more coherent, more elegant:
- We’re refining middleware defaults.
- We’re aligning naming and ergonomic details across modules.
- We’re expanding the docs — not just as feature lists, but as a living guide to **how** to build with TriFrost.
- We’re sharpening type safety, even in corners most frameworks would leave loose.
- Where necessary we're adding an option or two.

This is the invisible work that transforms a good tool into something you can trust deeply.

Or as Mr. Miyagi would say: **Wax-On, Wax-Off**.

### Why It Matters
It’s tempting, in open source and in software generally, to sprint from one big headline feature to the next. But TriFrost has always been guided by a different philosophy: **go deep, not just wide**.

We’re not here to flood you with endless plugins or surface-level integrations. We’re here to build something durable.

Something fast.

Something that feels right when you work with it.

And sometimes, that means stepping back from the roadmap and just ... you know ... polish.

### What’s Ahead
As the docs expand, you’ll see more of these focused mini-releases: small, thoughtful updates that make TriFrost more expressive, more predictable, and more satisfying to build with.

And yes: **1.0 is on the horizon**. We’re moving toward it carefully, intentionally — as a milestone with a **genuine mark of maturity**.

Stay frosty. ❄️
